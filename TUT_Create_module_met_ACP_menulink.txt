This simple little tutorial was created by request in response to a user asking how they could create a quick module for menu item link in the ACP top menu for a "Config Plugins" link.

As such, let us begin that simple task.

Ok, you can simply go into your forum root directory:

and navigate inside to:

[quote]
admin/modules
[/quote]

and say for example create a dir called:
[quote]
/config_plugs
[/quote]

in such newly created directory create a meta file called:

[quote]
module_meta.php
[/quote]


Add the following in that file:

[code]
<?php

if(!defined("IN_MYBB")){
 die("Direct initialization of this file is not allowed.");
}

function config_plugs_meta(){

global $page, $plugins;

    $page->add_menu_item("Config Plugins", "config-plugins", "index.php?module=config-plugins", 101);
}

[/code]

Now, for this example as you see in the images I used "Config Plugins" as the link text (you should notice the only text that has capitalization?), but you could simply change that to "Plugins" if desired.

Best of luck.
